Using this method, a cue (marking the start of a new trial) is required that instructs the user to start focusing on the symbol she wants to select. In contrast to the classical approach of using dedicated time intervals during which data is collected for a classiﬁcation, we are continuously presenting stimuli and collecting EEG epochs for each stimulus.

All the 32 videos displayed the same virtual mobile robot executing the same path with different display strategies.

With the last advances in neuroscience and brain-imaging technologies, some researchers have proposed the potential application of brain-computer interface (BCI) as an auxiliary channel for existing interaction solutions to support the industrial HRC [4,5]. Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that monitors the activity of the human’s central nervous system (CNS) to interpreting the users’ intention into the readable information [6]. With BCI, users can explicitly manipulate their brain activity instead of limb movements to produce signals that control external machines, which is a more direct and natural way to convey their intention [7]. However, it is still challenging for BCI to control a robot with high degree of freedom because of the limited number of mental states that could be classified in the existing BCIs which is unable to generate the high- dimensional commands . To overcome this problem, a potential solution can be to offer sufficient information\n","\n","that could record the user’s brain activity that can be translated into interaction messages (e.g., control commands) to the outside world, which is able to build a direct and efficient communication channel between human and robot . However , due to lacking of information feedback mechanism, it is challenging for BCI to control robots with high degree of freedom with the limited number of classifiable mental state. To address this problem, this paper proposes a close-loop BCI with contextual visual feedback by an augmented reality (AR) headset. In such BCI, the electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns from the multiple voluntary eye blinks are considered as the input and the its online detection algorithm is proposed whose average accuracy can reach 94.31%. Moreover, an AR-enable information feedback interface is designed which enable to achieve an interactive robotic path planning. A case study of an industrial HRC assembly task is also develop which shows that the proposed closed-up BCI\n","\n","A Closed-Loop Brain-Computer Interface with Augmented Reality Feedback for Industrial Human-Robot Collaboration Zhenrui Ji1,2, Quan Liu1,2, Wenjun Xu1,2*, Bitao Yao2,3, Jiayi Liu1,2, Zude Zhou1,2 1 School of Information Engineering , Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China 2 Hubei Key Laboratory of Broadband Wireless Communication and Sensor Networks, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China 3 School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan 430070, China * Corresponding Author: Wenjun Xu with phone: +86-13707181116; fax: +86- 27-87651800; email: xuwenjun@whut.edu.cn Abstract Industrial human-robot collaboration (HRC) aims to combine the human intelligence and robotic capability to achieve the higher productiveness.

In this paper, we introduce augmented reality feedback to achieve a close-loop BCI to control the robot in industrial HRC scenario. Firstly, from a practical point of view, we use the voluntary eyeblinks, which can be easily performed without intensive user-training and can generate relatively strong signals with stable patterns, as the input of the BCI user to communicate with robot. Secondly, an Optical See-Through (OST) AR headset is used to provide a contextual visual feedback according to the input of BCI user, which can achieve the complex robotic operation, such as the specify a trajectory of robot movement. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also deploy a BCI-AR interface in an industrial HRC task and compare its performance with [8], a hand gesture- based AR interface.
